  Compound bounding box for a model.

description: |
  This object contains a compound bounding box for a model, which defines
  a set of input-selectable bounding boxes.

examples:
  -
    - A compound bounding box with one selector_args and 1D bounding_box
    - |
      !transform/compound_bounding_box-1.0.0
        selector_args:
          - argument: x
            ignore: true
        cbbox:
          - key: [0] # value of input x is 0 to select this box
            bbox:
              intervals:
                y: [1.0, 2.0]
          - key: [3] # value of input x is 3 to select this box

              intervals:
                y: [4.0, 5.0]

definitions:
  selector_arg:
    description: |
      This object contains the description of a single selector argument.

    type: object
    properties:
      argument:
        type: string
      ignore:
        type: boolean
    required: [argument, ignore]

  selector_args:
    description: |
      This object contains a list of all the selector arguments.

  cbbox_entry:
    description: |
      This object contains a single input-bounding_box entry for a
      compound_bounding_box. Note that each key must have the same
      number of items as the selector arguments. Moreover, each value
      for a key is the actual input value for the model, not the name
      of the input

  cbbox:
    description: |
      This object contains the map of the bounding boxes. Note that
      each compound_bounding_box entry should have bboxes of the same
      size
