title: >
  A generic type used to mark where other transforms are accepted.

description: >
  These objects are designed to be nested in arbitrary ways to build up
  transformation pipelines out of a number of low-level pieces.


definitions:
  base_transform:
    type: object
    properties:
      name:
        description: |
          A user-friendly name for the transform, to give it extra
          meaning.
        type: string

      inverse:
        description: |
          Explicitly sets the inverse transform of this transform.

          If the transform has a direct analytic inverse, this
          property is usually not necessary, as the ASDF-reading tool
          can provide it automatically.
