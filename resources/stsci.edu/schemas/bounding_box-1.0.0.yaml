title: >
  Bounding box for a model.

description: |
  This object contains the bounding box for a model, which defines
  the domain of valid inputs to the model. For 1D models, it is a list
  of length 2, containing the lower bound followed by the upper bound.
  For models with 2 or more dimensions, it is a list of lists, where the
  list is in reverse input order and each sub-list is a list of length
  2 containing the lower bound followed by the upper bound.
